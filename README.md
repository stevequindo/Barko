## Features
1. **Company side**
	- Parsing data from (standardised) excel sheets
		- Drag/drop into software → Take all relevant data, organise into an entry for each individual box→ Company can update the individual boxes
	- Excel sheet received should be standardised or we can give them a standard template to follow
	- Future implementation: Maybe allow for different structures
		- Suggestion: Ask company to specify column names for their senders, receivers, transactions
	- Updating the status of customer boxes
		- Want to be able to see each transaction
		
2. **Customer side**
