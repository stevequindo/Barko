==================
Features
Company side
•	Parsing data from (standardised) excel sheets
o	Drag/drop into software → Take all relevant data, organise into an entry for each individual box→ Company can update the individual boxes
o	Excel sheet received should be standardised or we can give them a standard template to follow
o	Future implementation: Maybe allow for different structures
	Suggestion: Ask company to specify column names for their senders, receivers, transactions
•	Updating the status of customer boxes
o	Want to be able to see each transaction
Customer side:
•	Typing in tracking number and getting relevant information
Additional Features not needed in MVP:
•	Pinging the user when an update is made.
